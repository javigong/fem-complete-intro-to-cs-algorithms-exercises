/**
 * Search a 2D Matrix II

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value target in an m x n integer matrix matrix. This matrix has the following properties:

Integers in each row are sorted in ascending from left to right.
Integers in each column are sorted in ascending from top to bottom.
 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 5
Output: true
Example 2:


Input: matrix = [[1,4,7,11,15],[2,5,8,12,19],[3,6,9,16,22],[10,13,14,17,24],[18,21,23,26,30]], target = 20
Output: false
 

Constraints:

m == matrix.length
n == matrix[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 300
-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109
All the integers in each row are sorted in ascending order.
All the integers in each column are sorted in ascending order.
-109 <= target <= 109

const searchMatrix = (matrix, target) => {
  let m = matrix.length
  let n = matrix[0].length
  let i = m - 1
  let j = 0

  while (i >= 0 && j < n) {
    let element = matrix[i][j]

    if (element == target) return true
    else if (element > target) i--
    else j++
  }
  return false
}

test('Search 2D Matrix', () => {
  expect(
    searchMatrix(
      [
        [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
        [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
        [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
        [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
        [18, 21, 23, 26, 30],
      ],
      5
    )
  ).toBe(true)
})
