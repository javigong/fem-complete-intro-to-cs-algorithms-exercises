# 10 Points to Remember 

1. Logarithm: basic concept for Algorithms.

2. Graph Traversals
  - Pre-traversal
  - Matrix traversal
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Breath First Search (BFS)
  - Traverse Cyclic Graphs

3. Binary Search: used with sorted values.

4. Sliding Window Technique (left right pointers)

5. Recursion;
  - Traverse a Tree in Order
  - n Fibonacci
  - Height in a binary tree
  - Depth in nodes

6. Two Important Algorithms:
  - Inverting a Binary Tree
  - Reversing a Linked List

7. Suffix Trees: useful for String Problems

8. Heaps (Binary Heaps): to find max and min with time complexity of O(log n)
  - Max Heaps
  - Min Heaps

9. Dynamic Programming: solving small versions of a complex problem.

10. Sorting: with time complexity of O(log n), understand why is better than Bubble Sort.
  - QuickSort
  - MergeSort
